### Project Description:
3d FPS Game tournemant, with bots.  
### Instructions:


"make server" to compile the server. Port can be adjusted (for MVP version, to be changed in the future) in net/networking.h.     
"./server" to start a two player server      
  
Two clients can then each "make prog" and  "./prog" to initiate the client process, creating a graphical window in the process.      
Control movement with W/S going foward and back, and A/D yawing to the left and right.           


No shooting or winning yet (although you can die if you're creative with it), have fun running in circles with friends!
